As part of my deeplearning course, my team mate and I have worked on deep QA models attempting SQUAD dataset. We have tried summarizing the
answer conditioned on the question into a hidden state initially using RNN variants. Realising these models inability to capture important part of the supporting paragraph, we have incorporated attention layer as suggested in BiDAF paper.
