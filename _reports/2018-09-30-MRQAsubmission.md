I was fortunate to work along with my classmates as part of a course which allowed us to collaborate with IBM Watson QA team. With guidance of Rajashri Das, we worked on building a tool for analysing reasoning and knowledge required to tackle ARC dataset and a small analysis on how making the facts needed for answering a scientific question and thereby changing an open-doman problem to closed domain, the model performance increases drastically.

We were awarded the <strong>BestPaper</strong> award at ACL MRQA workshop' 18.
