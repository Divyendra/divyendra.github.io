As part of a coursework, few of my amazing classmates and I collaborated with IBM Watson QA team on building a tool for analysing the reasoning and knowledge abilities required for an AI model to tackle ARC, a dataset of science domain based multiple choice questions. We analysed the importance of an effective IR system able to get the facts needed for answering a scientific question by changing an open-doman problem to a closed domain variant and testing the reading comprehension model's performance; we showed that model performance increases drastically.

We were awarded the <strong>BestPaper</strong> award at ACL MRQA workshop' 18.
