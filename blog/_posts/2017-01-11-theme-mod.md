This is a [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) theme for my blog, based on [lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) style with additional features:
Hello World. How are you doing? THis is a a sample text filler to check the responsiveness of this file. More text and more text coming

List of Features:
* Configurable copywrite date for posts (date placed in the footer). You can now configure the date in `_data/theme.yml` file by setting "copywrite" value.
* Configurable author name used for meta tag and other parts of the site.
* Configurable description of the site, which was missing in the original template.
* Configurable charset for the site, by default set to UTF-8.
* Configurable keywords, although Google doesn't use them, some Chinese search engines still use them for creating results. Adding this configuration allows covering broader range of "consumers" of the site.
* Configurable disqus comments.
* Email icon in the social links.
* Text is justified in post paragraphs.
* Font is smaller (reduced to reasonable size).
* RSS feed contains excerpt from the posts instead of a full content.
