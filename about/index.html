<p>Hello, my name's Divyendra. I'm a Master's CompSci student at UMass Amherst</p>

<p>I was part of startups as a full-stack software engineer, and part of Cellworks, a lifesciences company, building cloud architecture for their scientific simulations. I am passionate about engineering and software modularisation. I am also passionate about machine learning techniques, thier usage in Natural Language processing and started investing time in these areas after coming back to Academia. In an attempt to catch up the pace of the research in this field: both breadth and depth, I write my notes and at times post these notes as blogs :)</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions over the content present in this blog, don't hesitate to shoot a mail! </p>

<p>You can find my resume here...<br/>
